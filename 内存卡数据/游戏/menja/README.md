# Menja

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/MillerTime/pen/BexBbE](https://codepen.io/MillerTime/pen/BexBbE).

A game about smashing cubes. Really just a prototype at the moment.  Also officially hosted here: [menja.cmiller.tech](https://menja.cmiller.tech/)

The whole thing is only 8kB when minified/gzipped, which I'm pretty happy with.

Menja is built from scratch using my [custom 3D renderer](https://codepen.io/MillerTime/pen/eLjxKB) and [Menger Sponge algorithm](https://codepen.io/MillerTime/pen/oaLZmW). The renderer is not at all efficient compared to WebGL, but it's tiny!

While the code here is editable, the [Github repo](https://github.com/MilllerTime/menja) is better organized.
